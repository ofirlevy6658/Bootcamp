We took the code we did in data massaging in JS and broke
the code. Copy the code (in the next page) and use the
debugging tool you have learned. Find the bug and post a
screen shot of where it fails from the debugging console
and explain the bug and the fix in your own words.


the bug is happend because we try to use forEach on object and not array,
we can print the proprety of the object as is if its only one object or put the objects in array 
and then use forEach.
